1. Calculate Remainders: Each number in the array can be represented by its remainder when divided by k. 
 public static int FindRemainder(int x, int k)
    {
        return ((x % k) + k) % k;
    }

2. Count Remainders: Create an array to store the count of each remainder.

3. Check Pair Conditions:
    Remainder 0: All numbers with a remainder of 0 must be paired among themselves, so there must be an even count.
    Other remainders: For each remainder r, the count of numbers with that remainder should match the count of numbers with remainder (k - r).
